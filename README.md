Library Application to store book collection.

Odin Project Objectives:

- Add new book with button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book.

- Remove book from library with button.

- Add a button that allows the user to toggle the read status of the book

- Associate these functions with the book object

- Extra features added by me include:

    - Sorting by title, author, total pages, published date and acquired date.

    - Statistics display that shows total number of books, unique authors, pages read, read books, unread books and deleted books.

    - Delete function that allows user to delete multiple books at once by selecting with checkbox, or selecting all books with one checkbox.
